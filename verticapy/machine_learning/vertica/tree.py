    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        Name of the model. The model is stored in the

    max_features: str / int, optional
        The number of randomly  chosen features from which
        to pick the best feature  to split on a given tree
        node.  It  can  be  an integer  or one of the  two

            auto : square root of the total number of
                   predictors.
            max  : number of predictors.
    max_leaf_nodes: PythonNumber, optional
        The maximum number of leaf nodes for a tree in the
        forest, an integer between 1 and 1e9, inclusive.
    max_depth: int, optional
        The maximum depth for growing each tree, an integer
        between 1 and 100, inclusive.
    min_samples_leaf: int, optional
        The minimum number of samples each branch must have
        after a node is split, an integer between 1 and 1e6,
        inclusive. Any split that results in fewer remaining
        samples is discarded.
    min_info_gain: PythonNumber, optional
        The  minimum  threshold  for including a  split,  a
        float between 0.0 and 1.0,  inclusive. A split with
        information  gain  less  than   this  threshold  is
        discarded.
    nbins: int, optional
        The number of bins to use for continuous  features,
