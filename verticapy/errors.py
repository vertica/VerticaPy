# VerticaPy is a Python library with scikit-like functionality to use to conduct
# data science projects on data stored in Vertica, taking advantage Vertica’s
# speed and built-in analytics and machine learning features. It supports the
# entire data science life cycle, uses a ‘pipeline’ mechanism to sequentialize
# data transformation operations, and offers beautiful graphical options.
#
# VerticaPy aims to solve all of these problems. The idea is simple: instead
# of moving data around for processing, VerticaPy brings the logic to the data.
