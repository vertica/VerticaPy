Autoamted Documentation using Sphinx
=====================================


`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/automatic-doc-generation.html>`_ 
is a widely used tool in the Python ecosystem that 
automates the generation of documentation for software 
projects. It streamlines the process of creating and 
maintaining documentation by allowing developers to write 
documentation content in reStructuredText (RST) format 
alongside their code. Sphinx then processes these RST 
files and produces professional-looking documentation 
in various output formats, such as HTML, PDF, and more.

One of Sphinx's key features is its ability to 
automatically extract documentation from docstrings in 
the source code. Developers can include docstrings - 
special comments within their code - to provide detailed 
explanations of functions, classes, and modules. Sphinx 
parses these docstrings, incorporates them into the 
documentation, and generates a cohesive and 
well-organized set of documentation pages. This ensures 
that the documentation stays closely tied to the 
codebase, reducing the chances of outdated or 
inconsistent information.

Here's a small example to illustrate how Sphinx works:

Suppose we have a Python module named 
``example_module.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    def add_numbers(a, b):
        """
        Adds two numbers.

        Parameters:
        - a (int): The first number.
        - b (int): The second number.

        Returns:
        int: The sum of the two numbers.
        """
        return a + b


By running Sphinx with the appropriate configuration, 
it can automatically generate documentation from the 
docstring in ``example_module.py``. The resulting 
documentation might include a page for the 
``add_numbers`` function with the specified 
parameters, return type, and a description extracted 
from the docstring. 


We can even add examples and other relevant 
information inside the docstring to guide the users
on how to use the function appropriately. 

Sphinx makes the documentation 
process more efficient, ensuring that developers can 
focus on writing clear and informative docstrings 
while the tool takes care of the presentation and 
organization of the documentation.
