          "Using Vertica ML, we now get results in almost real-time without any wait. Our new approach [in-database machine learning using Vertica] allows for tens of millions of models being calculated over filtered aggregated data in seconds and re-written in the database for almost real-time availability. This has been a real game changer for us."

          "Vertica is a data science ready database. You only have to know your business and let Vertica do the job. You don't need to be or have a data scientist, just use the out-of-the-box ML algorithms, feed data and in a matter of seconds you'll see insights, knowledge, predictions and more."

          "Vertica’s new in-database machine learning capabilities are like gold! We are extremely excited to train our Machine Learning models on our data in Vertica and ship them with our platform to run on our customers’ clusters. This is something that is much harder with any other tool. It will improve our competitive positioning."
