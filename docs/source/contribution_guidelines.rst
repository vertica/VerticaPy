Bug Reports
------------
   
If you find a bug, submit an `issue <https://github.com/vertica/VerticaPy/issues>`_ with a complete and reproducible bug report. If the issue can't be reproduced, it will be closed. If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own, comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue.

For issues (e.g. security related issues) that are **not suitable** to be reported publicly on the GitHub issue system, report your issues to `Vertica open source team <mailto:vertica-opensrc@microfocus.com>`_ directly or file a case with Vertica support if you have a support account.

Feature Requests
-----------------

Feel free to share your ideas for how to improve *VerticaPy*. We're always open to suggestions.
You can open an `issue <https://github.com/vertica/VerticaPy/issues>`_
with details describing what feature(s) you'd like to be added or changed.
   
If you would like to implement the feature yourself, open an issue to ask before working on it. Once approved, please refer to :ref:`contribution_guidelines.code`.
